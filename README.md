# Weather-App-js
This is a simple JavaScript Weather App that allows users to check the weather for a specific city. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Weather App, you'll need to obtain an API key from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and replace the `apiKey` variable in the code with your own API key.

## Features
Search: Users can enter the name of a city in the search box and click the search button to retrieve weather information.

Display: The app displays the city name, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon based on the current weather conditions.

Error Handling: If the entered city is not found, the app displays an error message.
